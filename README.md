Use your Fitbit to track your Stand Up Paddling sessions on the water.

Displays important statistics such as:
- heart rate
- current speed
- average speed
- max speed
- distance paddled
- total strokes*
- total session duration

**Please Note:**
I am using the step detection for counting the strokes. I tested it multiple times while paddling and I am quite happy with the count.
If you find problems or other things, please post add Github issues, or discuss in [this](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-App-Gallery/SUP-Support/m-p/3169975#M7201) forum thread and I will try to fix the issues.

## Further ideas (Help appreciated)
- Choose between two stats or one activity per screen in the settings
- enable or disable stats in settings
- Order stats in settings
- Disable touchscreen while activity is running

The application uses the Exercise API added in Fitbit OS 3.0 and is based on the sdk-exercise by Jon Barlow.
