Use your Fitbit to track your Stand Up Paddling sessions on the water.

Displays important statistics such as:
- heart rate,
- current speed,
- average speed,
- max speed,
- distance paddled
- total strokes*
- total session duration

**Please Note:**
I am using the step detection for counting the strokes. I tested it multiple times while paddling and I am quite happy with the count.

The application uses the Exercise API added in Fitbit OS 3.0 and is based on the sdk-exercise by Jon Barlow.
